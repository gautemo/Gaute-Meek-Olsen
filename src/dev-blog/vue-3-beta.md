Vue.js 3 has now reached [Beta](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next) ðŸ¥³

One of the things I'm most excited about is how to share state and logic between components without props and emits. Look at how we can keep our state and logic in its own JavaScript file and use it in the components we need.

I'm really looking forward to the official release. If you want to read about what's new and changed, take a look at my [previous article](https://dev.to/gautemeekolsen/vue-3-is-coming-3icj). And check out [this repository](https://github.com/gautemo/vue-3-playground) for how to set up a Vue 3 project today and more resources.
