Apparently Evan You (creator of Vue.js) wasn't interested in sleeping one night and created [Vite](https://github.com/vuejs/vite).

<script setup>
import Tweet from '../components/Tweet.vue'
</script>
<Tweet>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">As I was going to bed, I had an idea about a no-bundler dev setup (using native browser ES imports), but with support for Vue SFCs **with hot reload**. Now it&#39;s almost 6AM and I have PoC working. The hot reload is so fast it&#39;s near instant.</p>&mdash; Evan You (@youyuxi) <a href="https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1252173663199277058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 20, 2020</a>

Vite allows you to develop your Vue application with Single-File Components without any bundle step. Imports are requested by the browser as native ES module imports. The dev server intercepts requests to `.vue` files and compiles them on the fly. And it's instantly fast.

Note that Vite is Experimental ‚ö†Ô∏è I don't know what the future for Vite is or how long this article is valid. But consider this a future snack and something fun.

## Let's try it out

Create the following files

**Comp.vue**

```vue
<template>
  <button @click="count++">‚ö° {{ count }}</button>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data: () => ({ count: 0 }),
}
</script>

<style scoped>
button {
  font-size: 2rem;
}
</style>
```

**index.html**

```html
<div id="app"></div>
<script type="module">
  import { createApp } from 'vue'
  import Comp from './Comp.vue'

  createApp(Comp).mount('#app')
</script>
```

Then run:

```bash
npx vite
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000`, edit the `.vue` file to see changes hot-reloaded.

## Bundle for Production

Now let's build our production-ready app.

Create **package.json**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build"
  }
}
```

Run

```bash
npm i -D vite
npm run build
```

Check out the dist folder for your code.

Issues I stumbled upon.

- Error: Cannot find module 'tslib'
  - Fix: `npm i -D tslib`
- Error: ENOENT: no such file or director
  - Fix: create an empty dist folder manually

## Thoughts

It was really easy to get started and the development process is really fast as I can see my changes instantly. It's like a compile on the fly setup. So this looks really promising, maybe in some time, this will be the way we develop all Vue projects.

Evan You, keep doing your magic üßô

Fun fact: As vue = view in french, vite = fast in french.

Edit: Looks like Vite is concluded for now and will/might be picked up after Vue 3 has launched. But if you want to try Vue 3 beta today, this is the easiest way.

Edit2: I said it was concluded based on a [tweet](https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1253832934152376326) from Evan You. Looking at the [commits](https://github.com/vuejs/vite/commits/master) to the repo I guess it's still being worked on üòÉ.
