            When developing a website, it is usually wise to use a good framework. But which one should you choose? We will look at which are the most popular, and then go in-depth on the 4 most popular. We will then together find out what you like best when it comes to developing experience, performance, and ecosystem. I'm excited about who wins after we voted and hand out points!

            Do you feel that web dev has become slower and slower with time? With Vite we are finally getting rid of the slow feedback waiting for code to build and bundle during development, which got slower the bigger the project was. Now you will see your changes faster than you can move your eyes!

            "Firebase helps you build and run successful apps". But what does this mean? Firebase is a collection of products from Google which is built on Google Cloud and is kind of a backend as a service. Join to see how you can make a web application with a database, file storage, authentication, hosting, analytics, feature toggles, and more without leaving your frontend code. We are talking about serverless built on the Google Cloud Platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gaute is a Firebase enthusiast and has participated in 3 Firebase summits (Praha, Madrid, and Internet).

            The definition of Firebase is "Firebase is Google’s mobile application development platform that helps you build, improve, and grow your app."
            But what does this mean? Firebase is multiple products and services hosted in the cloud and does that we don't have to write backend code.
            We will take a look at how Firebase offers database, authentication, analytics, file storage, push notifications, machine learning and a lot more directly on iOS, Android and web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every Firebase project is also a Google Cloud Platform project. I'll explain the relationship and how they overlap.

            JavaScript is the most used programming language! It's coming with improvements and features which make life easier each year.
            I'll go through what's new in ES6, ES7, and ES8. This is for you that want to improve in JavaScript and keep updated with writing modern JavaScript.
            Lean back and watch live coding and code samples, this talk is for the ones who have done a little JavaScript and the more experienced 
            that doesn't have the latest syntax and functionality at their fingertips yet.

            Serverless functions are functions you write and deploy to a cloud provider. In this presentation, I give an overview of what a serverless function is, and what they can do, and give a comparison of the three big cloud providers Amazon with AWS Lambda, Microsoft with Azure Functions and Google with Firebase Functions. Afterward, I give a demo of how you can implement firebase functions to save your project.

            JavaScript can be time-consuming when the project gets large, because of readability and error detection. This is where TypeScript can help. TypeScript is JavaScript that scales, which provides you with types and new features. At the end your TypeScript file will be compiled into a JavaScript file you can use as normal.

            Firebase is a bunch of tools that help you build, improve and grow your mobile or web application. Firebase makes it easy to get started, but it also scales well since it runs in the Google Cloud. In this workshop, we are using hosting, authentication, and Firestore to get our web application working. Since Firebase is our backend, both server and API, we get a lot of functionality in a short time.
