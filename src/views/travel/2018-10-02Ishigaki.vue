          First, let me tell you how lovely Ishigaki is. The place does not have many tourists, so finding a beach completely for yourself is really easy.
          The water shifts between transparent, green and blue as I have never seen before. Beaches of fine grain sand and a lot of interesting and beautiful shells.
          Yes, I picked someone to bring back to Norway. Smaller islands around you can take a ferry to visit, gives you a lot to explore.
          Sunrises, sunsets and starry nightsky.

          As the storm has passed Ishigaki and I'm getting the lovely weather Ishigaki usually has, it's time to enjoy the island!
          So let me tell you about my two days with beautiful weather.
        </section>
        <section>
          First I took the ferry to Taketomi Island, which is a must visit when you are in Ishigaki. Ramon decided to join.
          It was a really nice day. A lot of swimming in the ocean, walking around exploring the island, eating, seeing hundreds of butterflies.
          I'll just show you the pictures.

          The hostel I'm staying at this time is smaller. We are much more a group here, compared to in Beijing. Almost everything we do,
          we all do together. We all have some relaxing days here. It's nice. I think I might like the smaller hostels better. During my stay, I was with
          persons from Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, Germany, and Argentina. Most of them from Japan, as Ishigaki doesn't seem that well known to the outside world.
          One day we were invited out to eat and drink for free,
          by a local politician who uses to hang out at our hostel. He and a few others, amongst a super energized old celebrity who needs to stand up every time he talks,
          spends some time in the common area at the hostel.
          We ended up in the newspaper. I guess now I'm supporting his election. Hopefully, he's promoting good things. At least he is a nice man.
          When he found out I was from Trondheim he started looking at google maps and seeing the photos. 'oh, nice'.

          One morning we decided to wake up to see the sunrise at 06:30. What happened was that the guy from Hong Kong started a meditating session with us.
          I didn't know I signed up for that. I like the idea of meditating, but I just can't do it for more than 10 minutes. He kept the group going for an hour,
          I couldn't sit there for that long. So after a while, I went wading in the water while they did their thing. Afterward, he took us mindful walking,
          giving us instructions as we walked slowly. I liked that better, when he instructs along the way. We walked to a shrine, where he was like
          'You want to do a different meditation for 15 minutes?' So we sat down, he started with an instructional meditation. But then as time went on, he got quieter.
          He was tricking us... 'Did you know how long you meditated?' I only partly meditated, I started doing other stuff after some minutes. '40 minutes'. Sneaky bastard.
          Hong Kong Samuel is a Buddhist
          who live in a monastery. He is something special. For me, it's like he lives in his own reality. Very positive, with the attitude of if you just believe it,
          it will happen. He has a lot of stories. He once talked about people not eating and drinking. I said that was crazy doing on purpose, but not longer than a month
          I asked. Over 30 years he answered! Then I just called out his bullshit, saying that's impossible.
          'There are many special things happening in this world, you can't explain everything.' Who do you believe?
        </section>
        <section>
          But I really like Samuel, he was a nice guy! And he made a lot of food. He was making breakfast, lunch, and dinner for everyone who sat in the common room. Everyday.

          The other day it was time to go snorkeling and see the must-see Kabira bay. Hiro knew this hidden beach called Crystal Beach.
          It was super nice, first time I have done snorkeling (I think). Ramon also decided to leach onto my plan this day.
          There wasn't really that much coral reefs to see at this beach. There are other places better for that at Ishigaki,
          but then you need the time to go to one of the small islands or have another wind direction, which affects which beaches are good for snorkeling.
          But the fishes! It was like swimming in an aquarium! It was amazing seeing fishes with different colors and sizes.
          I especially liked the bright blue ones. Something like this, just more shiny;

          One night I, Amy, Ramon, and Franko went up to the top roof of the hostel to watch the stars and shooting stars.
          <span class="open-info" @click="info = 'Light pollution affects how clear you will see the stars on the night sky. Since cities often produce a lot of lights, i.e. streetlights. You will not be able to see all the stars. Ishigaki has a lot less light pollution, giving us an incredible night sky to look at.'">ðŸ’Œ</span>
          <p>I have always been fascinated by space,
          but I started ruminating while I lay there. You can click on the envelopes for some facts about space, as of course, I looked it up afterward.
          Some of the envelopes I knew from before, I'll just add them for fun.</p>
          The night sky was clear, with almost none clouds. Giving us a clear view of the stars. A lot of stars, they looked like a network cluster
          <span class="open-info" @click="info = 'There are about 5000 stars visible from one side of the planet. Let\'s say each star has 9 planets. I am now looking out at 45000 planets, I just can\'t see them. There has to exist aliens. That\'s only how many I can (not) see with my human eye. But the astronomers estimate there exists 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars. A lot more than the stars visible for the human eye. But I think you can only multiply it with 1.6 planets per star. So more planets than the huge number of stars. There has to exist aliens!'">ðŸ’Œ</span>.
          In between shooting stars
          <span class="open-info" @click="info = 'Shooting stars are meteors that hit the earth\'s atmosphere, it heats up and burns making it glow.'">ðŸ’Œ</span>
          appeared. After a while, the moon appeared. I'm thinking about why the moon appears so late, compared to in Mongolia when I could see the moon and sun at the same time
          <span class="open-info" @click="info = 'Japan\'s and Mongolia\'s moonrise time is pretty similar. It has just gone some days since I was in Mongolia. The moon obviously uses one month to orbit the earth. So a month later the moonrise will be at the same time again. The full moon is when the sun and the moon are on opposite sides of the earth.'">ðŸ’Œ</span>.
          I thought I couldn't see the same stars as I do in Norway. Because we are looking out in space in different directions.
          <span class="open-info" @click="info = 'Which stars you see on the night sky depends on your latitude. As I thought, we look out in different directions. But there is an overlap of the stars we see. So some stars we can see from both Japan and Norway, but not all.'">ðŸ’Œ</span>
          I was a little wrong.
          It was really nice, we lay there looking at the stars, sparingly talking, until some of them fell asleep.
          When Franko went to bed and Ramon to eat ice cream, it was just me and a sleeping Amy left.
          So I awoke Amy so we could go down. On the way down she took pauses, sleeping on the wall. As Ramon came back,
          inviting Amy for ice cream, I just said 'Amy, it's okay to go to sleep'. I don't think I have seen someone that sleepy.

          This is a place I'm coming back to! Then I would like to rent a car to drive around and not be dependent on the bus schedule.
          I would like to spend some days and sleepover at one of the small islands. The islands should have some really beautiful corals,
          rare blue coral, which makes snorkeling(and diving) even more interesting.
