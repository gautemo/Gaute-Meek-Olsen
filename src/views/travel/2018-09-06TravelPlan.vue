        So I'm starting a travel blog. Why? Mainly to have something to look back at myself.
        And for family and friends to get an insight into where I am and what I'm doing.
        I don't really expect much traffic here, but if you are interested, keep reading!

        Who am I? I'm a shy Norwegian who hasn't been outside Europe yet.
        But that is going to change! I'm going to explore Asia (and some of the European part of Russia)
        for the next 5 weeks and a day. Russia, Mongolia, China, and Japan are my destinations.
        See the map above for the cities. None of them are English (or Norwegian) speaking countries.
        So I might be in for some challenges. And I'm solo traveling. I will take the trans-Mongolian railway from Moscow to
        Beijing, which part of it is on the trans-Siberian railway, which is the worlds longest railway.
        After some days in Beijing, I will fly to Japan and be there for about two weeks.

        So the plan is to post some blogs while I'm away.
        But I'm not just a shy Norwegian. I'm also a nerd, sporty, positive, happy,
        adventurous and probably a lot of other stuff as well. If your interested in this blog,
        keep your eyes open and enjoy!
