        I've been a little sick lately, so that's not an ideal beginning. But it's nothing worse than to push through.
        Also, I only got a few hours of sleep last night, so it was a hard start waking up 5:30. But with some sleeping on the flights,
        I'm good to handle Moscow. Lesson one, I need to plan better for exactly how to get from the airport to wanted destination.
        I stood there not knowing where to go, so I had to buy a data package allowing me to spend some GB on my phone in the next seven days.
        It's not the worst decision, as it will really come in handy, but $crooge McDuck on my right shoulder was not pleased.
        Then I went to an ATM to withdraw some cash, but what happens, the ATM is giving me the card back with just the tip out of the ATM.
        I was grabbing it with all my strength, but it was stuck. So it sent it back, and out again, giving me a new chance. The same happened,
        I'm looking to my right and seeing a man giving me the 'oh no' look <span class="smiley">ðŸ˜¯</span>. Then the ATM swallows my card for good, with the message
        'Go burn in hell, your not getting your card back'. Luckily I have one card and a Mastercard left, so next, I inserted my other card into the ATM...
        No of course not, that ATM brand or bank or whatever it is, is now my enemy! I went across the room to the other ATM and I got my cash, but with one card less
        already. I tried calling the hotspot number on the ATM, but was answered with
        the automatic voice recording 'press #1 for that, #2 for that...' But it was in Russian, so I have given up on that card.
        Luckily it was the Revolut card, which is super easy to freeze.

        The Russians are as bad in English as I am in Russian, so communication is hard. But at least the people were nice and trying to help.
        And to my surprise, a lot of the signs were both in Russian and English. So getting around was quite easy. Even though I did quite the large amount of walking,
        just to avoid the hassle of finding out how to take the metro around the city. But I got to see the red square, which was my goal.
        Even though the streets were packed with people because Moscow had birthday or something, being 871 years old. So that was a little bummer, trying to see
        the city when every citizen is out on the streets is not that cool.

        I'm not that impressed with Moscow, feeling it just being a city, with nothing special about it. So I don't think this is a place I'll come back to (but you never know).
        But that's okay, because Moscow was kind of just the beginning of the Transmongolian railway, never really been a place I've wanted to see.

        Despite having a little rough start, I'm really happy and positive. Now sitting on the train station eating some calories, that I've had a little too few of today.
        Getting ready for being on a train for 51 hours. Time to see the places I'm really looking forward to. Feeling that the cities will almost get better and better from now on,
        to the highlights in Japan.
