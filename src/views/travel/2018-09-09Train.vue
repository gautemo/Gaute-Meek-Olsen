        I'm about to enter the train when seeing that I need to show my passport along with the ticket to enter.
        But I could not find my passport. I don't always remember where I have put things last, but I always know It's either there, there or there.
        So when it was not in my left pocket, in the travel detail zipper or in the smaller backpack. I was like, oh shit. Is this where my trip ends?
        So I started checking, other places where I knew it could not be, pouring my backpack onto the street. But I had outsmarted myself, by wearing a
        body pocket, I had totally forgotten about. Phew... I use the body pocket so that if I lose my backpack, get robbed or something,
        I would still have my passport and a Mastercard. From not on I'll just have to remember it as a place, and a 'there' place for my passport.

        I am walking into the wagon a little stressed, and it's hot, really hot. Way to hot to wear a hoodie and pants.
        Seeing just beds stacked next to each other, with what I assume only Russian people. Families to elder people.
        I did not see the bed numbers, so I was walking a little blindly. Trying to ask 'where are the numbers?' But nobody answered,
        or probably knew what I was saying. But then I found them and found my bed. The lady in the next bed started immediately pointing and speaking
        Russian to me. It was hard finding out what she wanted. But she was really helpful, showing me where to put my stuff under the bed,
        rolling on the mattress and putting on the bed sheets. All of this I could have done myself, but it was nice having a helpful lady.
        Since it was late at night, people were starting to sleep. But the lights were on, and I was wondering if we were going to sleep in the lights.
        But a little later, the lights were turned off.

        The next day, the helpful lady kept going. She asked me a lot of questions, with me just looking dumb back <span class="smiley">ðŸ˜¶</span>, I could not answer a single thing.
        But she gave me breakfast, some homemade loaf with fried onion baked inside, it tasted ok, but nothing more. And every time I finished one, she gave me a new one,
        so I had three. She did not take no for an answer. She also brought me tea and a snack bar. She has now left the train, hungry I guess.
        It's about 14:30, 15 hours of 51 completed.
