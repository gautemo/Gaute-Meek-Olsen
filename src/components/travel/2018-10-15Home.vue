          Right now I'm sitting on the last plane from Moscow to Oslo. Two and a half hour seems like a short flight, after the ten-hour flight from Tokyo.
          The sunset is as orange, as only the most creative can imagine. I saw the sunset, as we had boarded the flight and was waiting for take-off.
          It wasn't like the whole heaven was orange, it was just over the horizon.
          Then it faded away. Now as we have been flying higher and higher, and towards the west. We caught up with the sunset. It's like we are chasing it.
          Never ever has a sunset lasted this long. Almost the entire flight. I can only imagine how happy the pilots are, as they get to look straight at it.
          It's still good from my window though.
          I love orange!<span class="smiley">üß°</span>

          I'm now home! I'm completely changed! Life-changing experience! I found myself!

          No. Not at all. I think I'm pretty much the same as before I left.
          A boy who already knows himself as good as possible and sometimes stumbles in the dark of eternal space. Like most humans are.
          Sometimes you are lost in your thoughts not being sure of anything and sometimes you are confident in where you are heading.

          I was away for a little over 5 weeks. Exactly 10% of the year actually. Before I left I thought, if you are going to backpack you need to be away for at least
          half a year. But I have discovered that's not true. Most of the people I met were like me, being away from anything between 3 weeks to 6 weeks.
          Only a few going away for a year or three. What do I think of my length? It was quite good. I felt I was away long enough to see a lot of places and have
          many experiences.

          Solo traveling, is it lonesome? I rarely get lonely, even though I spend a lot of time alone.
          So if you are not like me, you could have had a different experience on my trip.
          But except for a night in Mongolia, I never felt lonely during my solo traveling. And I'm introverted, shy and a bad small talker.
          So I think solo traveling is really no problem and you should just do it. At the majority of hostels, you will meet other people.
          It kind of varied from place to place, somewhere I was completely alone and sometimes I was doing things with people.
          I have had a lot of in the moment friends. I don't think I will meet anyone ever again. But who knows,
          I have connected on a lot of the ones I met on different social media.

          One way to plan a trip is to book group tours or events waiting for you at a destination. I did no such thing, just booked
          transportation and accommodation to where I wanted to go. With no plan on what to do once I arrived.
          Just made my own itinerary. I can tell you that's also an option that works pretty well.
          Every place I have either met someone and done something with them or I have used Google Trips to find out what to do at the place.
          Russia, Mongolia, and China needed a visa with booking confirmation from how to get in, out and where you're staying.
          So for those countries, my route was a little more planned. In Japan, it was a little more open.
          Me visiting Nara and Kyoto was not something I knew I was going to before I left.

          Everything went as it should be, not missing any trains or flights. No trouble, no blunders, no robbing, no scamming, no accidents, no nothing.
          So I did not face any big challenges during my trip. The entire trip has gone smooth.
          Actually, the hardest part about my trip was swallowing the typhoid vaccination pills before I left.
          Even though they were really small and slim, I just couldn't get them down at first. I only swallowed the water and the pill is left.
          My brain goes 'oh, this is not chewed. Sorry, but you're not going down'. I'm lucky I'm never sick and never have to take painkillers or other pills.

          In Novosibirsk and Irkutsk, I booked a hotel room for a few reasons. One reason was that I thought I was going to be tired from the train. Struggling sleeping in a packed
          wagon. But that was not a problem at all, I slept very easy and well on the trains. So that is not a valid reason for not sleeping at hostels.
          Maybe I would have chosen differently in those cities if I could turn back time.

          I have seen many beautiful things in the last 36 days. I have tried capturing the moment with my mobile camera.
          But mostly it cannot capture what I'm actually seeing. Maybe I should have brought a better camera for such a trip!

          This blog has primarly been for myself, so I can look back at my journay. But I know I have some

          Some content along the way may have seemed random or squished in, that's because I just wanted to get the moment down,

          Now I'm going to get rich and earn a billion dollars! Then quit my job and travel for the next 20 years. Yes, you don't need a billion for that.
          But after 20 amazing years, I'm going to pay all the money to a smart human to build me a time machine.
          Then I'll use it to travel back in time and create a family which I want to have.
          But the thing is I would like to travel more. I think I will try to do something similar next year. Where?
          Maybe Australia, Nepal, Canada, Peru, New Zealand, Iceland, Phillipines, Ireland or places in Norway. Who knows, I'm not gonna plan it this far ahead.

        <section>
          Will there ever be a new travel blog? Who knows. Hopefully, there will be. I'm going to the Czech Republic in two weeks for 4 days.
          Not sure if I will make blogs for such small trips or wait for my next big trip to fire this site up again.
          I don't know when my next big trip will be. But it's going to be!
