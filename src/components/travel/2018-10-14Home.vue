          -what I missed: card, kg
          -what I learned: I thought a backpacking trip needed to last atleast half a year to be real backpacking. That is not true, some weeks also works!
          -what I overpacked: linen sleepingbag, I read that you should bring it, but no bed is that dirty (atleast not where I went), you can always shower later

          The end?
          Maybe for a while. I'm going to Chevhz for 4 days in 2 weeks. Maybe I will put out a blog then. But I don't know when my next big trip is going to be. But its going to be.
