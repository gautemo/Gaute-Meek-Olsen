          My second day in Tokyo I went out to a park and ate my breakfast looking at a nice pond.
          I sat at a bench next to a girl. I don't know how people can turn having an ant crawling on them into a long conversation.
          I would like that power. She was Saba from Canada, an electrical engineer, traveling Japan for two weeks.

          In the evening the hostel held a dinner party. Someone told me it was kind of famous as the international television channel had talked about it.
          Some Japaneese come to practice their english. So we were a mix of guests, voulenteer walkers, and Japanese.
          There are a lot of travelers volenteering in this hostel. Working 20 hours a week for free stay at the hostel.
          So we are a group of French, USA's, Canadian, Scots, Paraguays, Japanese, and me. There were drinking games,
          so I'm a little tired now as I'm about to leave the hostel and head for a capsule hostel.

          Yes, I decided to change hostel. I liked being in this hostel. Just because of the people. The hostel has no style,
          everything looks bad and having just the minimum things that are necisary. If your business is having guests,
          you should make an effort making the place look at least a little nice. But I want to try the capsule hostels in Tokyo.
          Thats why I'm changing.
